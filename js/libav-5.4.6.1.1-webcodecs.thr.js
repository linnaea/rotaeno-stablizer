 *
 *  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 *  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 *  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 *  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 *
 * [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 *  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 *  the version number 2.1.]
 *
 *                             Preamble
 *
 *   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 * freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
 * Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
 * free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
 *
 *   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
 * specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
 * Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
 * can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
 * this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
 * strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
 *
 *   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
 * not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
 * you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
 * for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
 * it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
 * it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
 * these things.
 *
 *   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 * distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
 * rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
 * you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
 *
 *   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
 * or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
 * you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
 * code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
 * complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
 * with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
 * it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
 *
 *   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
 * library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
 * permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
 *
 *   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
 * there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
 * modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
 * that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
 * author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
 * introduced by others.
 *
 *   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
 * any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
 * effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
 * restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
 * any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
 * consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
 *
 *   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
 * ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
 * General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
 * is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
 * this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
 * libraries into non-free programs.
 *
 *   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
 * a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
 * combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
 * General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
 * entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
 * Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
 * the library.
 *
 *   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
 * does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
 * Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
 * of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
 * are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
 * libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
 * special circumstances.
 *
 *   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
 * encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
 * a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
 * allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
 * library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
 * case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
 * software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
 *
 *   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
 * programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
 * free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
 * non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
 * operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
 * system.
 *
 *   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
 * users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
 * linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
 * that program using a modified version of the Library.
 *
 *   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 * modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
 * "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
 * former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
 * be combined with the library in order to run.
 *
 *                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 *    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 *
 *   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
 * program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
 * other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
 * this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
 * Each licensee is addressed as "you".
 *
 *   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
 * prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
 * (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
 *
 *   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
 * which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
 * Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
 * copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
 * portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
 * straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
 * included without limitation in the term "modification".)
 *
 *   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 * making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
 * all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
 * interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
 * and installation of the library.
 *
 *   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
 * covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
 * running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
 * such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
 * on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
 * writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
 * and what the program that uses the Library does.
 *
 *   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
 * complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
 * you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
 * appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
 * all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
 * warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
 * Library.
 *
 *   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
 * and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
 * fee.
 *
 *   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
 * of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
 * distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
 * above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 *
 *     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
 *
 *     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
 *     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
 *
 *     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
 *     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
 *
 *     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
 *     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
 *     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
 *     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
 *     in the event an application does not supply such function or
 *     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
 *     its purpose remains meaningful.
 *
 *     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
 *     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
 *     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
 *     application-supplied function or table used by this function must
 *     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
 *     root function must still compute square roots.)
 *
 * These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
 * identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
 * and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
 * themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
 * sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
 * distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
 * on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
 * this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
 * entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
 * it.
 *
 * Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
 * your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
 * exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
 * collective works based on the Library.
 *
 * In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
 * with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
 * a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
 * the scope of this License.
 *
 *   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
 * License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
 * this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
 * that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
 * instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
 * ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
 * that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
 * these notices.
 *
 *   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
 * that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
 * subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
 *
 *   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
 * the Library into a program that is not a library.
 *
 *   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
 * derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
 * under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
 * it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
 * must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
 * medium customarily used for software interchange.
 *
 *   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
 * from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
 * source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
 * distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
 * compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
 *
 *   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
 * Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
 * linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
 * work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
 * therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
 *
 *   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
 * creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
 * contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
 * library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
 * Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
 *
 *   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
 * that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
 * derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
 * Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
 * linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
 * threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
 *
 *   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
 * structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
 * functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
 * file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
 * work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
 * Library will still fall under Section 6.)
 *
 *   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
 * distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
 * Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
 * whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
 *
 *   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
 * link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
 * work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
 * under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
 * modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
 * engineering for debugging such modifications.
 *
 *   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
 * Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
 * this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
 * during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
 * copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
 * directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
 * of these things:
 *
 *     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
 *     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
 *     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
 *     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
 *     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
 *     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
 *     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
 *     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
 *     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
 *     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
 *     to use the modified definitions.)
 *
 *     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
 *     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
 *     copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
 *     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
 *     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
 *     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
 *     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
 *
 *     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
 *     least three years, to give the same user the materials
 *     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
 *     than the cost of performing this distribution.
 *
 *     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
 *     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
 *     specified materials from the same place.
 *
 *     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
 *     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
 *
 *   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
 * Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
 * reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
 * the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
 * normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
 * components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
 * which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
 * the executable.
 *
 *   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
 * restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
 * accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
 * use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
 * distribute.
 *
 *   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
 * Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
 * facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
 * library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
 * the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
 * permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
 *
 *     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
 *     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
 *     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
 *     Sections above.
 *
 *     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
 *     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
 *     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
 *
 *   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
 * the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
 * attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
 * distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
 * rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
 * or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
 * terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
 *
 *   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
 * signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
 * distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
 * prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
 * modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
 * Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
 * all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
 * the Library or works based on it.
 *
 *   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
 * Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
 * original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
 * subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
 * restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
 * You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
 * this License.
 *
 *   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
 * infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
 * conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 * otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 * excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
 * distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
 * License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
 * may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
 * license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
 * all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
 * the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
 * refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
 *
 * If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
 * particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
 * and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
 *
 * It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
 * patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
 * such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
 * integrity of the free software distribution system which is
 * implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
 * generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
 * through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
 * system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
 * to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
 * impose that choice.
 *
 * This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
 * be a consequence of the rest of this License.
 *
 *   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
 * certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
 * original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
 * an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
 * so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
 * excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
 * written in the body of this License.
 *
 *   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
 * versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
 * Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
 * but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
 *
 * Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
 * specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
 * "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
 * conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
 * the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
 * license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
 * the Free Software Foundation.
 *
 *   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
 * programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
 * write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
 * copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
 * Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
 * decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
 * of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
 * and reuse of software generally.
 *
 *                             NO WARRANTY
 *
 *   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
 * WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
 * EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
 * OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
 * KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
 * IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 * PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
 * LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
 * THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 *
 *   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
 * WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
 * AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
 * FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
 * CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
 * LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
 * RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
 * FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
 * SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 * DAMAGES.
 *
 *                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 *
 *            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
 *
 *   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
 * possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
 * everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
 * redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
 * ordinary General Public License).
 *
 *   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
 * safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
 * convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
 * "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 *
 *     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
 *     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
 *
 *     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
 *     modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
 *     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
 *     version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
 *
 *     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
 *     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
 *     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
 *     Lesser General Public License for more details.
 *
 *     You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
 *     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
 *     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 *
 * Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 *
 * You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
 * school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
 * necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
 *
 *   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
 *   library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
